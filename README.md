## [Json Data]() is a simple fake REST API for testing and prototyping.
## Motivation 
Most of the time when trying a new library, hacking a prototype or following a tutorial, I found myself in need of some data.

I didn't like the idea of using some public API because I had the feeling that I was spending more time registering a client and understanding a complex API than focusing on my task.

But I liked the idea of image placeholders for web designers. So I decided to code a little Express server inspired by that and here is JSONPlaceholder.

## Features

- Zero-config
- Basic API
- "Has many" relationships
- Filters and nested resources
- Cross-domain (CORS and JSONP)
- Supports GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and OPTIONS verbs
